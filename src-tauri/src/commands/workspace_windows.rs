//! Reopening the workspace windows that were open when codeg last quit.
//!
//! A workspace window is the local `main` window or a remote workspace window
//! (`remote-workspace-{id}`, at most one per saved remote connection). The
//! window-state plugin puts each of them back where it was, but only once
//! something builds it again — and at launch the only thing that did was the
//! setup hook building `main`. Every launch therefore came back to the local
//! workspace alone, however many remote workspaces had been open.
//!
//! So this module keeps the list of open workspace windows, least recently
//! focused first, writes it to `app_metadata` whenever a window joins or leaves
//! it and once more at quit, and replays it at the next launch:
//!
//!   * `main` is always built — the tray, the dock, deep links and the close
//!     prompt all hang off it — but it starts hidden when it had been closed
//!     (hidden to the tray) at quit and something else is coming back instead.
//!   * The remote windows reopen in the background, behind the same health
//!     check a manual open runs, and in the remembered order, so the window
//!     that was in front at quit is in front again.
//!   * A remote workspace that cannot be reopened brings `main` up with a toast
//!     saying why ([`take_workspace_restore_failures`]), rather than leaving a
//!     window silently missing — or no window at all.
//!
//! "Open" means "not closed by the user": a minimized window is open, and so
//! is every window of an app hidden with ⌘H, while `main` hidden to the tray is
//! closed. `is_visible()` cannot tell those apart (it is false for all three),
//! which is why the list is kept from the hide / show / focus / destroy events
//! as they happen instead of being read back from the windows at quit.
